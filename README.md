# Quine Test

A simple [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) tester.

Clone master, and run `npm test` to see if you've made `index.js` a quine.

The goal is to write a node script that when run, prints the entirety of its source code. No recursive file reads, no `eval()` statements.
